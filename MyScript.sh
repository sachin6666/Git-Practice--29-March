HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.
• origin refers to the source repository from where it was cloned. 
• git diff : View difference between Stage and Working Directory
• git diff --staged : View difference between HEAD and Staged
• git diff HEAD : View difference between HEAD and Working Directory
- Staged and index both are same
- Unstaged changes exist in our Working Directory, but Git hasn’t recorded 
them into its version history yet. 
- Staged changes are a lot like unstaged changes, except that they’ve been 
marked to be committed the next time you run git commit
